title: Presenter View with Projector Sync
---

Earlier this month marked the addition of the [Projector view](/projector-view) for decks. Starting today, decks now have a third view, the Presenter. This update applies to all users, free and pro.

The Presenter view is currently no different from the Public view, except for one major difference. As you move through your deck in the Presenter view, the Projector view stays in sync, thanks to the power of [Pusher](http://pusher.com/). Presenters can now project their slides from their browser and control the action from a separate browser window, another computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.

At this time the Projector and Presenter views are only viewable by the logged-in owner of the deck, and only one Projector view will sync with the Presenter at a time.
