Users can now upload PDFs to create online decks. Users of [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com) or [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net) will be familiar with this workflow.[^1]

Keynote, PowerPoint, and Impress all let users export to PDF.

Upload that PDF to DeckCloud.

DeckCloud will turn your PDF into images and display them as an online deck. Free accounts can upload one deck. Pro users can upload up to 20.
