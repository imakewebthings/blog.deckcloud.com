Decks should look different depending on the viewer. The link you share with the public should have different functionality from the version you project onto a screen during a talk. With this is mind, decks now have a projector view:

Currently, this just removes the parts of the public view that are not necessary during projection, such as the slide status number and next/previous navigation links. This leaves the audience to focus on what matters: you, your slides, and what you have to say.
