title: Free and Pro Accounts
---

Starting today, anyone can create a <a href="https://deckcloud.com/user/new">free account</a> with DeckCloud. Once you've created a free account, you can upgrade to a Pro account for $9/mo. Pro accounts have a free 30-day trial. Let's look at what that Pro account gets you:

- A badge, displayed in the header when you log in. This badge isn't displayed publicly, since there are no public user pages.
- That's it.

### Wait, Back Up

What exactly is DeckCloud? Today, it's nothing, but the goal is to create tools that improve the presentation experience for both speaker and audience. I believe the best first feature is a reasonable business model, a way to pay for this service. Hence this post.

In reality, upgrading to a Pro account at this point is ridiculous. You get nothing for your money. A Pro upgrade would be no more than a recurring donation. I expect nobody to do it. But over time, I hope to build something worthy of the subscription. Look for more feature updates here in the future.
